# Kulan-main Project

## Overview

## Key Concepts and Technologies Used

- **React**  
  The project uses React functional components and hooks (`useState`) to manage state and handle user interactions.

- **Framer Motion**  
  Animations and transitions are implemented using the `framer-motion` library, providing smooth fade-ins, staggered animations, and hover effects.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Styling throughout the application is done using Tailwind CSS utility classes, enabling rapid and responsive UI design.

- **API Integration**  
  The newsletter subscription form submits data to the Web3Forms API, handling asynchronous requests and providing user feedback on submission status.

- **Component-Based Architecture**  
  The application is structured with reusable components such as navigation bars (`Upnav`, `Lownav`) and a footer (`Footer`), promoting modularity and maintainability.
